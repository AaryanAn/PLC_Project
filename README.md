## Project Overview
The **PLC_Project** represents a comprehensive journey through the principles of programming language design and implementation. It includes modular solutions to compiler design, interpreters, and analyzers, developed as part of the **Programming Language Concepts (COP 4020)** course at the University of Florida.

This project showcases:
- Building a **Lexer** for lexical analysis.
- Constructing a **Parser** for grammar-based language parsing.
- Developing an **Interpreter** for runtime evaluation.
- Implementing an **Analyzer** for semantic checks.
- Generating executable code using a **Code Generator**.

## Features
- **End-to-End Compiler Design:** Starting from lexical analysis to code generation.
- **Interpreter Implementation:** Evaluate runtime expressions and execute instructions.
- **Semantic Analyzer:** Ensures correctness in variable scoping, type usage, and function calls.
- **Code Generator:** Translates high-level language constructs into executable representations.
- **Testing Suite:** Comprehensive unit tests for each project milestone.
- **Modular Design:** Each component (Lexer, Parser, Interpreter, etc.) is independently testable and reusable.

## Learning Outcomes
This project adheres to the course objectives, ensuring proficiency in:
- Implementing **Compiler** and **Visitor** design patterns.
- Creating modular and maintainable solutions for language constructs.
- Debugging and enhancing existing codebases effectively.
- Using automated testing to validate implementation correctness.
- Designing and implementing solutions based on academic principles and industry practices.
